            The Ten-Tec Omni VI is an HF Transceiver for the 160 through 10 metre WARC bands. It was designed by US company
            Tennessee Technology Inc. in the 1990s and at the time had a list price of $2585. It is still considered by
            some enthusiasts to have unmatched receive performance, particularly in CW mode. The model for restoration was
            purchased for Â£200, described as almost complete and working, but requiring full re-alignment
            (which could hide a multitude of problems!).

            <i>
                OMNI VI is the culmination of two decades of engineering in high performance HF transceivers. 
                It features an advanced phase locked loop synthesizer combined with an oven controlled crystal
                oscillator for superior phase noise performance and stability. A large LED display is used
                for ease of viewing the operating frquency. Two smaller displays for a 24 hour clock and RIT/XIT offset.
                The OMNI VI also provides 100 duplex memories, scratch pad memory, band registers, dual VFOs,
                direct frequency entry and a built-in Iambic keyer.
                <br>
                The OMNI VI covers all bands 160 through 10 meters, using CW (with full or semi break-in),
                SSB (with built-in speech processor), RTTY (true FSK or AFSK) and FM. Optional crystal filters can be
                installed in both the 6.3 MHz and 9 MHz IFs. Also included is automatic notch filter provided by a DSP
                processor, a programmable CW transmit offset, and a CW digital lowpass filter. Remote control of many of the 
                transceiver functions is possible via a serial interface.

            Quite impressive for the 1990s.

            <strong>Part 1. The Logic Board</strong>
            <br>
            As an embedded Software Engineer, this is of particular interest. It uses an 80C32 microprocessor operating at
            20 MHz,  with 32K EPROM and 8K battery backed RAM, and a 2105 DSP processor with a serial CODEC to provide the
            automatic notch filter. A 20 MHz oven controlled crystal oscillator provides the reference frequency for the 
            transceiver. This was the first problem - due do age the crystal had "cooked out" and was off frequency and unstable.
            An exact replacement part is no longer available as it was made from unobtainium. A newer device would certainly
            work but would not fit in the space available on the logic board.

            Using today's technology most of this board could be replaced with a single IC.
